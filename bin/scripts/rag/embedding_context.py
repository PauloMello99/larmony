"""Build the enriched text that actually gets embedded for a chunk.

Previously only `payload["text"]` (the bare body) was embedded, discarding the
document type, identifier, section, and breadcrumb the indexer already computes.
That made same-named sections across documents (e.g. every ADR's "Consequências")
embed near-identically.

`build_embedding_text` folds that structural context into a deterministic,
human-readable block so the vector captures *what* the text is and *where* it
lives, not just the words. The format is stable across re-indexes (lines with
empty values are omitted), which also makes it a sound basis for chunk hashing.
